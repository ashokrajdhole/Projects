This is a home automation and saftey project.
I made this project by own I made 3 prototype that were compact but since I was exploring and learning new things so I almost destroyed 2 of them.
At last I made a full fleg working project that is operated using a android application developed by my friend and database that is used is firebase.
Images and code is uploaded
